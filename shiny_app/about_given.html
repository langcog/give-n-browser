	<h3>Number Acquisition</h3>
	<p>While children begin to recite the count list at a very young age (usually by around 2 years; Fuson, 1988), it takes them several years to learn the meanings of the individual words in the count list. For instance, if you ask 2-year-old who can count up to 10 for a set of 3 items, they will give you a random handful.
	</p>
	<p>Instead of learning the meanings of all these number words at once, children begin by learning them one at a time over the course of several months. At around 2.5  years, children learn the meaning of "one," such that they can generate a set of <i>one</i> when requested, but still give randomly for other numbers. Some months later, children learn the meaning of "two," and then "three" a few months after that. During this time, children are called "subset-knowers," meaning that they understand only a subset of the number words in their count list. Additionally, even though subset-knowers still recite the count list, they do not reliably use it to generate these known numbers, indicating that they do not fully understand the relation between counting and cardinality.</p>
	<p>Around 3.5-4 years, children discover how to use counting to generate sets of any number, meaning that they no longer need to learn the meanings of number words one by one. At this point, children are called Cardinal Principle (or CP)-knowers, meaning that they understand how the last word said while counting indicates the cardinality of a set (Gelman & Gallistel, 1978).</p>

	<h3>About Give-N</h3>
	<p>The Give-N task (Wynn, 1990), allows researchers to measure what children know about the meanings of number words and counting. In this task, an experimenter asks children to generate a set of <i>N</i> items. For example, in a typical session the experimenter might ask children to "Put <i>three</i> bananas on the plate." The researcher continues asking for different numbers until they find the largest set for which children can reliably generate a set. For example, a child who can only generate sets of 1 and 2 is a "two-knower," while a child who can generate sets of 5+ is generally classified as a "CP-knower."</p>
